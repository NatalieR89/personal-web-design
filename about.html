                <p>
                    This game began as a passion project, a dream born from childhood memories of building and creating with LEGO. Over time, my love for both the world of tabletop wargames and the creativity that LEGO offers merged into something special. I wanted to bring together the thrill of strategic battles and the joy of constructing unique, custom armies out of one of the most iconic toys in history.
                    With years of playing, designing, and refining, I’ve crafted a game that’s more than just a set of rules—it’s an invitation to build, to compete, and to immerse yourself in a world where strategy and creativity meet at the table. I believe that every battle tells a story, and every piece you place on the board is a step toward shaping that story in your own way.
                    I'm proud to create a space where everyone, regardless of background or identity, can come together to build and play. As a proud LGBTQ+ friendly community, I'm committed to inclusivity, creativity, and celebrating the diversity that makes our game—and our world—better.
                    Whether you’re here to perfect your tactics or to let your imagination run wild, our game is for you. Together, let’s build a battlefield that’s as limitless as your imagination.
